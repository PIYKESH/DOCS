Bash Scripting

*It is a command line interpreter or a shell that we use on our Linux or UNIX systems,
* To evaluate something is bash we have to use (expr) for adding sub or any math.
* Astrik * is consider as wild card to multiply use \*
* ne is opposite of eq
* -f is used for file and -d is used for directory to check for file or directory.

#!/bin/bash
if [ -f ~/myfile ]  
then
echo "The file exists."
else
echo "The file does not exist."
fi


* command - v is use in command line for commands to, it helps to check whether the command is available or not.
#!/bin/bash

command=htop

if command -v $command
then
echo "$command is availabale, let's run it .. "
else
echo "$command is Not available , let's install it"
sudo apt upgrade && sudo apt install -y $command
fi

$command

*man command is for help gives information of command

*exit codes it used to check whether the command was successful or not.
*This helps in many scenarios when script is failed which is running automatically it exits with different codes and we can place another piece of code to trigger and send email, 

Example:
root@ubuntu:/home/piyush# ls -1 /games
ls: cannot access '/games': No such file or directory
root @ubuntu: /home/piyush# echo $?
2


* The greater  than signs shows  >> is append the output of command and save it to file.
#! /bin/bash

package=notexist,
sudo apt install $package >> package_install_result. log


if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
echo "The installation of $package was succesful"
echo "The new command is available here:"
which $package
else
echo "$package failed to install"
fi



*While loops

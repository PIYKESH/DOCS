Docker 
1- Docker is a advanced version of virtualisation in form of Containerisation.
2- Hypervisor is used for virtualisation but in case of Containerisation we use Docker Engine.
3- Docker provides all the dependencies in an environement which prevent's confilcts for code version or it can be anytghing. 
4- Docker uses Container on the host O.S to run the applications to use the same linux kernel as system on the host computer,rather than creating new a whole new virtual O.S.
5- We can install in any O.S but docker engine runs natively on Linux Distribution. 
6- Docker was first released in march 2013 by Soloman Hykes and Sebastian Pahl, Which is written in GO language.
7- Docker is a set of platform as a service that uses O.S level virtualisation where VM Vare uses Hardware level Virtualisation.
8- Disadvantages:- a) Docker is not a good solution for application that requires rich GUI.
				   b) Docker does not provide cross-platform compatibility if an application is designed to run in docker.
				   c) Docker is suitable when Dev O.S and OPS O.S are same, If the O.S is different then we should use VM.

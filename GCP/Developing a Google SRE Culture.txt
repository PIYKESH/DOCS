DevOps and SRE--> It's important to understand that DevOps is a philosophy versus a development methodology or technology. Although DevOps philosophy highlights critical ways for IT teams to operate, it doesn't give explicit guidance on how an organization should implement practices 
                  to be successful.That's where SRE comes in Just as DevOps aims to close the gap between software development and software operations, this new SRE approach is a concrete way to solve problems that the DevOps philosophy addresses. Note that SRE is both a practice and a role.
